Description: Performs single or multiple imputation of missing data using the
    missForest algorithm by Stekhoven et al. Variations on the training and
    prediction steps are available to monitor convergence and improve variance
    of missing data distribution, or to mimic Multiple Imputation by Chained
    Equations (known as MICE) using random forests.
